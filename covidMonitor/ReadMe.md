This project was designed and built from scratch to learn how to call and consume API data from an API I found that returns data about the COVID-19 Pandemic all around the world.

This project was only meant to be a learning tool and is not hosted anywhere but if you would like to see it running, please feel free to download the project files and use LiveServer in VSCode to run the index.html file in the src directory
