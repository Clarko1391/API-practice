# API-practice
 
Practice applications and websites built to better understand how to use APIs in vanilla js

All projects have been designed and coded 100% from scratch. None of these projects are hosted as they are only meant to be a learning tool. If you would like to run any of these projects you just need to download the files and use LiveServer in VSCode to run the index.html file in the src directory of the project.
