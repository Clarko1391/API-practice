This project was designed and built from the ground up based on a Chuck Norris Joke API that I found online. This was just meant to a goofy little project to help me learn how to consume APIs within a basic web application and is not hosted anywhere.

If you would like to check it out please feel free to download the project files and use LiveServer in VSCode to run the index.html file.
